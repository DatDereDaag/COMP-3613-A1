# Internship Management System CLI

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) built with Flask and Click for managing an internship system, including operations for **Employers**, **Staff**, and **Students**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3** and **Flask** installed. The project also relies on `click`, `pytest`, and specific Flask extensions like `Flask-Migrate`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (assuming this code is part of a larger Flask application):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DatDereDaag/COMP-3613-A1
    cd [your-project-directory]
    ```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** (assuming a `requirements.txt` exists that includes Flask, Click, etc.):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Commands

All commands are executed using the `flask` command, followed by the command name or group and command name.
